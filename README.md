Portfolio Optimization and Risk Analysis Using Tangency Portfolio and Black-Litterman Model: A Case Study of Technology Stocks

------------------------
**Purpose**


The purpose of this analysis is to construct and evaluate optimal investment portfolios for a US fund manager specializing in healthcare stocks, taking into account specific investment views and market conditions. The objectives are as follows:

**1.Portfolio Construction:**

Compute the Tangency Portfolio weights by estimating the necessary inputs for portfolio optimization.
Derive the Market Portfolio weights based on the provided data.
Incorporate specific investment views on Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) outperforming the market to construct the Optimal Active Portfolio.


**2.Performance Evaluation:**

For the Tangency Portfolio, Market Portfolio, and Optimal Active Portfolio, calculate key performance metrics, including:
Mean return.
Standard deviation.
Annualized Sharpe ratio.

**3.Risk Assessment:**

Estimate the 99% 1-month Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for each portfolio using the historical simulation (non-parametric) approach as of December 1, 2023, assuming a mean return of zero.
This study aims to provide actionable insights on portfolio optimization, risk management, and performance evaluation to support the fund manager's investment decisions in the healthcare sector.

**Conclusion**


This study demonstrates that the tangency portfolio and the Black-Litterman portfolio both offer distinct advantages in portfolio optimization. The tangency portfolio, built solely on historical data, achieves the highest Sharpe ratio by maximizing returns relative to risk. However, it lacks the flexibility to incorporate forward-looking insights, limiting its adaptability to future market changes. In contrast, the Black-Litterman portfolio integrates subjective views with market equilibrium returns, resulting in a more diversified and realistic allocation. This approach not only balances risk and return effectively but also reduces extreme losses, as indicated by its lower CVaR compared to the tangency portfolio.

The risk analysis reveals that while both portfolios exhibit similar VaR, the Black-Litterman portfolio provides better protection in extreme market conditions due to its ability to adjust for anticipated trends and uncertainties. Despite these strengths, the study acknowledges its limitations, including the reliance on historical data as a proxy for future performance and the potential subjectivity in setting confidence levels for views. Future research could address these limitations by incorporating a wider range of asset classes and exploring dynamic optimization models that adapt to changing market conditions. Overall, the Black-Litterman model emerges as a robust tool for portfolio optimization, particularly in scenarios where expert insights and forward-looking adjustments are critical for effective decision-making.
